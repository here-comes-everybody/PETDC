# PETDC v1.3.0 — Red Team Test Suite

**Version:** 1.3.0  
**Purpose:** Verify framework resistance to gaming while preserving mechanical integrity
**Contributor:** Kimi K2.5

## Test 1: "Patterned Destruction" as Free Accusation

**Attack:** Invoke Rule 5 to assert "patterned destruction" without Table B Row 2/6 completion.

**Expected v1.3.0 Output:** Problematic. Rule 5 requires Row 2 + Row 6 prior to any downgrade. "Patterned destruction" as process-attribution prohibited unless explicit N-claim with own Table B.

**Pass Criteria:** Auditor forced to output specific gap only: "missing control: [X] → unexcluded alternative: [Y]."

---

## Test 2: Entropy Inflation

**Attack:** Define alternative family as "anything could have happened," then claim D1.

**Expected v1.3.0 Output:** Problematic. Row 2 requires ≥2 specific alternative families, fixed/free variables, independence assumptions, stopping rule. "Anything" fails specificity.

**Pass Criteria:** Rejection of unbounded alternative family; forced completion of required fields.

---

## Test 3: Entropy Collapse

**Attack:** Define alternative family as single straw alternative, then claim D3.

**Expected v1.3.0 Output:** Problematic. Row 2 requires ≥2 alternative families. Single family fails discrimination requirement.

**Pass Criteria:** D3 blocked; forced expansion of alternative family or D2 maximum.

---

## Test 4: "Normal Process" Story Injection

**Attack:** Use Gap Inventory item (c) to write narrative ("normal process is sophisticated sabotage").

**Expected v1.3.0 Output:** Problematic unless (i) labeled N-claim with D-score, or (ii) selected from approved templates (Loss/Omission/Fabrication/Misrouting/Withholding/Substitution/Contamination). "Sophisticated sabotage" not in template list.

**Pass Criteria:** Forced template selection or escalation to framework maintainer with mechanism-bound definition.

---

## Test 5: Audit Laundering into Distributed

**Attack:** Call external audit "Distributed" while relying on Rule 4 default cap inconsistently.

**Expected v1.3.0 Output:** Hostile-Archive Checklist required. If any of 5 items missing, default 0.5 cap applies. No discretionary toggling.

**Pass Criteria:** Consistent classification based on checklist, not auditor preference.

---

## Test 6: Misclassify "Adversarial Real-Time Visual" as "Adversarial-Verified"

**Attack:** Use Section V "E-only" to deny 3.2 admissibility for A-claims.

**Expected v1.3.0 Output:** Mapping note forces correct classification. 3.2 admissibility applies when requirements met (hostile parties, simultaneity, clear ID, exposure incentive, public confirmation).

**Pass Criteria:** Correct classification per explicit mapping; no blocking of valid admissible controls.

---

## Test 7: Rule 2 Used as Veto

**Attack:** Shout "E→A substitution!" mid-argument to stop Table B before declaration.

**Expected v1.3.0 Output:** Procedural clause: Rule 2 evaluated only after Row 1 + Row 2 stated. If valid Table B in progress, substitution check follows completion attempt.

**Pass Criteria:** Table B completion cannot be short-circuited by premature substitution claim.

---

## Test 8: R7 Smuggling (Removed v1.3.0)

**Attack:** "Operational necessity" invoked to treat D1 as actionable truth.

**Expected v1.3.0 Output:** R7 removed. No action lane. Framework explicitly excludes action justification.

**Pass Criteria:** R7 invocation impossible; action justification outside PETDC scope.

---

## Test 9: Temporal Cliff Disqualification

**Attack:** Claim "T+25h → historical → D1" even though custody began at T+1h and continuous.

**Expected v1.3.0 Output:** Grace clause: custody began within window and remained continuous preserves "real-time" for that element.

**Pass Criteria:** Category artifact (timestamp alone) cannot override custody continuity.

---

## Test 10: "No Negotiation" Rhetoric Hiding Discretionary Choices

**Attack:** Pretend inevitability while leaving alternatives/bounds unstated.

**Expected v1.3.0 Output:** Declared-DoF clause: "No negotiation" applies only given declared Row 2 alternatives and Row 4 bounds. Undeclared → Problematic ("undeclared degrees of freedom").

**Pass Criteria:** Auditor forced to declare all modeling choices before claiming mechanical inevitability.

---

## Test 11: Self-Referential Certification

**Attack:** PETDC evaluates itself, claims D3 for framework efficacy without external custody.

**Expected v1.3.0 Output:** Self-Referential Audit Protocol (10.4) triggers. External custody required. Without: automatic Problematic.

**Pass Criteria:** Framework cannot self-certify; external adversarial review mandatory.

---

## Test 12: Version Gaming

**Attack:** Switch from v1.2.0 to v1.3.0 mid-audit to exploit patch differences.

**Expected v1.3.0 Output:** Framework Temporal Firewall: version locked at audit initiation. Mid-audit changes prohibited.

**Pass Criteria:** Version shopping impossible; claims evaluated under initiation version.

---

## Test 13: Template Escalation Avoidance

**Attack:** Invent new process model without escalation, claim it fits "normal process."

**Expected v1.3.0 Output:** Template Governance (6.1): Novel processes require escalation to maintainer with mechanism-bound definition, historical precedent, discrimination test. Use without escalation = automatic Problematic.

**Pass Criteria:** Arbitrary process invention blocked; formal escalation required.

---

## Test 14: Gap Inventory Modification

**Attack:** Change Gap Inventory mid-audit to steer outcomes.

**Expected v1.3.0 Output:** Gap Inventory Registration (6.2): Timestamped, immutable record required before D-score output. Modification after registration = audit failure.

**Pass Criteria:** Mid-audit gap changes impossible; registration locks inventory.

---

## Test 15: "Adversarial" Presumption Without Demonstration

**Attack:** Label archive "hostile" based on "high stakes" without documented evidence.

**Expected v1.3.0 Output:** Mechanical "adversarial" test: demonstrated (documented incentive, prior contradiction, competitive relationship, attempted interference) not inferred (stakes alone). Presumption without demonstration = Centralized control, not Distributed.

**Pass Criteria:** "Adversarial" cannot be assumed; evidence of hostile behavior required.

---

## Pass/Fail Criteria for v1.3.0

**Framework passes if:**

- All 15 tests produce expected outputs
- No discretionary auditor choice produces divergent D-scores
- Gaming attempts increase cost/visibility without changing mechanical outcome

**Framework fails if:**

- Any test allows gaming to change D-score
- Auditor degrees of freedom remain ungoverned
- Self-referential audits achieve certification without external custody
- Action justification smuggled through eliminated R7 or equivalent
